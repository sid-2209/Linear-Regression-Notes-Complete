# Regression in ML Notes Complete

A growing collection of my personal notes on regression fundamentals. This repo is a living document, and I’ll keep updating it as I explore new ideas, methods, and examples.

## What's Inside
**1. Univariate Linear Regression** — Modeling simple one-variable relationships. <br>
**2. Multiple Linear Regression** — Extending the model to multiple predictors. <br>
**3. Polynomial Regression** — Capturing nonlinear patterns with higher-degree terms. <br>

## Sample Images
- **Contour Plot Explanation (left image)** <br>
- **Gradient Descent Convergence Check (right image)**
